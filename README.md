- 👋 Hi, I’m @patrick-lanquetin, living in Paris.
- 👀 I’m interested in:
    - How Large Language Models (LLM) could capture more knowledge and abstraction from a smaller corpus of text
    - How too use LLM and VLM at work in the workflow of activities to assist users to produce answer, document, presentation, flowchart, code, etc.
    - Video frame interpolation and Video2Video
- 🌱 I’m currently reading many academics papers from arxiv about LLM, attention, metalearning, metaprompting
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on project and studies to build augmented corpus, augmented embedding, augmented LLM, using method and attention to abstract knowledge from text
